This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of lung cancer risk based on various lifestyle factors and clinical indicators.

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and aggressive forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates. This project aims to:

1. Identify the most significant risk factors (e.g., smoking, age, peer pressure).
2. Visualize the correlation between lifestyle habits and cancer occurrence.
3. Develop a classification model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in patients.
